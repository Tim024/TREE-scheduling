/**
 * \defgroup pca9685 PCA9685 LED driver
 *
 * This provides all the methods and types to control a PCA9685 LEDs driver.
 *
 * The PCA9685 is a 16channel LEDs driver that can control a PWM signal on each
 * of its 16 channels. These PWMs can hence control the power of LEDs for example.
 *
 * Each of channel may be configured with a PWM value between 0 and 4095,
 * corresponding to 0-100% respectively.
 *
 * The platform definition has registered one or several PCA9685 chips to this
 * driver. It is possible to retrieve their number and their references through
 * \ref pca9685_get_number and \reg pca9685_get.

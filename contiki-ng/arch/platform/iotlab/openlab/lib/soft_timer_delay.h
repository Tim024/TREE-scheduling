/**
 * \defgroup soft_timer Software timer
 *
 * The Software Timer library uses a single hardware 16bit timer running with
 * a 32kHz clock to provided extended functionalities such as:
 *   - 32bit timer emulation
 *   - active delays
 *   - as many timer alarms as wished
 *   - use of the \ref event library for executing handler functions
 *
 * The hardware timer used by the library is configured in the initialization
 * section of each platform.
 *
 * When started, the soft timer counts time using its hardware timer. This time
 * value corresponds to an up-time, i.e. the time elapsed since the platform has
 * booted. This time value may be used to timestamp events or data, or to compare
 * time events.
 *
 * \see \ref example_soft_timer_delay.c for an example of using the
 * \ref soft_timer_alarm functions, and \ref example_soft_timer_alarm.c for an example of using
 * the \ref soft_timer_alarm library.

 *   - %d: display a signed int, padding with zeros or spaces is allowed (e.g. %04d or %5d)
 *   - %x and %X: display an int in hexadecimal form padding with zeros or spaces is allowed (e.g. %4X or %06x)
 *   - %c: display a character
 *   - %s: display a string padding with spaces is allowed (e.g. %4s)
 *   - %f: display a float, no padding is allowed, NaN and Inf values are allowed
 * \param format the string to be printed with special control sequences that are listed above.
 * \param ... the list of variables to be displayed. The number of variable must be consistent with the format string
 * \return the number of written characters excluding the terminating zero

/**
 * \defgroup event Event library
 *
 * Event posting for executing functions.
 *
 * This library provides an event mechanism allowing to post events, i.e. functions,
 * to be executed by the library tasks.
 *
 * The library creates two tasks with on each one a queue (FIFO) of events.
 * These tasks repeatedly take an event from their queue, extract the handler function
 * to call and call it.
 *
 * The difference between the different tasks of the library is their priority.
 * There two tasks run with different priority, allowing for example a network
 * stack to run with hard real time constraints and an application with less
 * real time requirements with a lower priority.
 *
 * Event posting allows independent libraries or applications to share a reduced
 * number of tasks, as those cost a lot of RAM on the processor. Furthermore,
 * an event mechanism is ideal to implement a finite state machine or equivalent
 * development models.
 *
 * It is possible to post events either from a task context, or from an interrupt
 * service routine context, in which case the method prefixed with _from_isr
 * MUST be used.
 *
 * The inside queues are FIFO, hence after posting an event, its corresponding
 * handler function will be called after all the previously posted events are
 * done.
 *
 * These tasks and queues directly rely on FreeRTOS tasks and queues.
 *
 * If an application creates other FreeRTOS tasks, note that the two created
 * tasks use priorities defined as (configMAX_PRIORITY - 1) and
 * (configMAX_PRIORITY - 2)
 *
